# AI Engineer | LLM Agent Development | Computer Vision

I'm an AI Engineer at Hexaware Technologies, developing intelligent LLM-based agents for SAP Financial Accounting automation. With expertise spanning computer vision, medical image analysis, and enterprise AI systems, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and production-ready solutions.

## Current Focus
- **Enterprise AI Automation**: Building LLM agents for SAP FI module automation using LangChain and FastAPI
- **Computer Vision**: Developing segmentation models for medical imaging analysis
- **Research to Production**: Translating academic research into scalable enterprise solutions

## Professional Journey

My journey in AI began with research—developing language identification systems at IIT Mandi and advancing computer vision across diverse domains at the University of Florida, from materials science with the SMART Data Lab to medical image analysis with the GONG Lab. This research foundation led me to industry applications at Satlantis LLC, where I optimized satellite image processing pipelines for production-scale deployment. Today, at Hexaware Technologies, I build intelligent LLM-based agents that automate enterprise SAP systems, which gives me a unique perspective on both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of AI across diverse domains.

## Technical Expertise

My technical stack spans the full AI/ML development lifecycle:
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TensorFlow, MONAI
- **Computer Vision**: Medical imaging (DICOM), satellite imagery processing, segmentation models
- **NLP/LLM**: LangChain, Transformers, CLIP, RAG systems
- **Enterprise Integration**: FastAPI, SAP OData APIs, microservices architecture
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, HPC clusters, distributed computing

<!-- ## Technical Background

I bring a combination of academic research experience and practical industry applications to AI/ML projects. My work spans from developing novel segmentation models for medical imaging to building enterprise automation systems. -->

<!-- I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->

<!-- How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
